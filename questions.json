Here they are Dynamic vs. Static Typing: The very first difference between both of the powerful languages is the way they handle variables individually. Java uses static typing in which it wants the user to define the variable type when the user initially declare it and further, will not enable you to change the type later on in the program. Whereas, Python utilized dynamic typing, in which user is free to change the variable type.Braces vs. Indentation: Python make use of indentation so as to separate into blocks. Whereas, Java utilizes curly braces to clearly define the starting and end of every function as well as class definition.Speed  The plus point of the Python programming language is that its programs tend to run quite faster than the Java programs.(function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement('script');ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai)",

But this copy function only makes the copy of reference that means if we change the new object then this will change the original as well.So, we use deep copy of the copy module so that we can create a new object with original one and can modify the newly created object separately.",

Due to the dynamic nature of the python, we can replace the body of a class function to new one. It is very useful in testing the python application. For example, if we have any class method which returns some api data and during testing, we don.t want the api data and use some local data then we can change the function and assign another function to it.",
